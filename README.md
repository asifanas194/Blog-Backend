The BlogApi folder contains the backend, and the Blog-Frontend folder contains the frontend.

Inside the backend folder, there is a PostmanCollection.json file which contains all the API collections.

In the backend, open appsettings.json and replace the connection string with your own. After that, run the necessary commands to update the database.

Once the backend is connected successfully, run the backend server first, and then start the frontend.
